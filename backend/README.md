# Wilson Chess Server

This is the server that hosts https://nanwar.ca and handles backend requests. It's also one of the first production backend's that I've written. This server serves the frontend `deploy/index.html`, it also controls authentication, account creation and leaderboard changes. It's made with Node.js, Express.js and deployed with Deta (Space).
